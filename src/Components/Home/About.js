          Their documentation was detailed and easy to follow, even for someone
          who has been coding for only a couple of months. However, managing API
          requests was the most difficult part of this project, because the
          application would crash if Iâ€™ve exceeded API calls from all users.
          Likewise, if the application is unresponsive it is likely that too
          many API requests were made. Allow a couple of minutes for the
          requests to refresh.{" "}

          This is my first major project and I have made a lot of changes
